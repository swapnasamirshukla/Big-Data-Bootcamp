    "### Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?\n",
    "**Answer**: Python is called a general-purpose language because it's designed to be used in a wide variety of application domains, from web development to data science to robotics. It's high-level because it abstracts many of the details of computer operation, allowing programmers to focus on logic and functionality rather than low-level operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?\n",
    "**Answer**: Python is dynamically typed because variable types are determined at runtime, rather than being specified at compile-time. You don't have to explicitly state the type of a variable when you declare it; Python will figure it out for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?\n",
    "**Pros**:\n",
    "- Readable and maintainable code.\n",
    "- Extensive standard libraries and community contributions.\n",
    "- Supports multiple programming paradigms.\n",
    "- Good for rapid development.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**:\n",
    "- Slower execution speed compared to compiled languages like C++.\n",
    "- Global interpreter lock (GIL) makes it less suitable for multi-threading.\n",
    "- Higher memory consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?\n",
    "**Answer**: Web Development, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, AI, Scientific Computing, Game Development, Network Servers, Software Development, Robotics, and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. What are variables and how can we declare them?\n",
    "**Answer**: Variables are named locations in memory used to store data. In Python, variables are declared by simply assigning a value to a name, like `x = 10`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?\n",
    "**Answer**: You can use the `input()` function to take user input as a string. E.g., `user_input = input(\"Enter something: \")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?\n",
    "**Answer**: The default datatype is `str` (string).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8. What is type casting?\n",
    "**Answer**: Type casting is the conversion of one data type to another, like converting an integer to a float, or a string to an integer. E.g., `int(\"10\")` converts the string \"10\" to an integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using a single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?\n",
    "**Answer**: Yes, you can take multiple inputs by splitting the string returned by `input()`. For example: `x, y = map(int, input(\"Enter two numbers: \").split())`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q10. What are keywords?\n",
    "**Answer**: Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and uses. Examples include `for`, `while`, `if`, `else`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.\n",
    "**Answer**: No, you can't use keywords as variables because they are reserved for special functionalities in the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentation in Python?\n",
    "**Answer**: Indentation refers to the whitespace used at the beginning of a line of code. In Python, indentation is used to define the scope of loops, functions, and classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?\n",
    "**Answer**: You can use the `print()` function to output data to the console. E.g., `print(\"Hello, World!\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q14. What are operators in Python?\n",
    "**Answer**: Operators are symbols that perform operations on one or more operands. E.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `**`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q15. What is the difference between / and // operators?\n",
    "**Answer**: `/` performs floating-point division, while `//` performs integer (floor) division.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q16. Write a code that gives the following as an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"iNeuron\" * 5)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "number = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "if number % 2 == 0:\n",
    "    print(\"Even\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Odd\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q18. What are boolean operators?\n",
    "**Answer**: Boolean operators like `and`, `or`, and `not` are used to perform logical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q19. What will the output of the following?\n",
    "- `1 or 0`: 1\n",
    "- `0 and 0`: 0\n",
    "- `True and False and True`: False\n",
    "- `1 or 0 or 0`: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?\n",
    "**Answer**: Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q21. What is the use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?\n",
    "**Answer**: `if` is used to test a condition; `elif` is used to test additional conditions if the initial `if` fails; `else` is used to specify what to do if all `if` and `elif` conditions fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q22. Write a code to take the age of a person as an input and if age >= 18 display \"I can vote\". If age is < 18 display \"I can't vote\".\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"I can vote\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"I can't vote\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]\n",
    "print(sum(x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a, b, c = map(int, input(\"Enter three numbers separated by spaces: \").split())\n",
    "print(\"Greatest:\", max(a, b, c))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q25. Write a code to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the specified conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number must be divisible by five\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]\n",
    "for num in numbers:\n",
    "    if num > 500:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "    if num > 150:\n",
    "        continue\n",
